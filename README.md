A program which uses Convolutional Neural Networks to classify facial expressions from an image into 7 categories: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise and Neutral. The whole code was implemented in python using TensorFlow. Different Techniques like Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation and Batch Normalisation were used to improve the performance.
